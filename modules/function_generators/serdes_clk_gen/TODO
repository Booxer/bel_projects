g_with_sync = false sometimes has the clock output hanging LOW
==============================================================

The output of a clock can sometimes hang low _indefinitely_ after setting of the
clock values for a channel. I say "sometimes" as this does not seem to happen
for a determined frequency. This problem seems to stem from a timing mis-match
between the setting of a channel's registers and the old value at the output
(outp_*_d0).

It is worth pointing out that this problem only affects the module when
g_with_sync = false. With the synchronization FSM, the module works
appropriately.
